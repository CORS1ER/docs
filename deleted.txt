Option 1: Sending from a hardware wallet
----------------------------------------

Set up your Trezor using the Trezor wallet at https://wallet.trezor.io/
and send a test transaction to verify that it is working properly. For
help on this, see :ref:`this guide <hardware-trezor>` - you may also
choose to (carefully!) `add a passphrase <https://blog.trezor.io/passphrase-the-ultimate-protection-for-your-accounts-3a311990925b>`_
to your Trezor to further protect your collateral. Create a new account
in your Trezor wallet by clicking **Add account**. Then click the
**Receive** tab and send exactly 1000 Genix to the address displayed. If
you are setting up multiple masternodes, send 1000 Genix to consecutive
addresses within the same new account. You should see the transaction as
soon as the first confirmation arrives, usually within a few minutes.

Once the transaction appears, click the QR code on the right to view the
transaction on the blockchain. Keep this window open as we complete the
following steps, since we will soon need to confirm that 15
confirmations exist, as shown in the following screenshot.

While we are waiting for 15 confirmations, download the latest version
of the Genix Masternode Tool (DMT) from the GitHub releases page `here
<https://github.com/Bertrand256/Genix-masternode-tool/releases>`__. Unzip
and run the file. The following window appears.

Click the third button from the left **Check Genix Network Connection**
in the top left corner of the main window to verify that the connection
is working. Then connect your Trezor device and click the next button
**Test Hardware Wallet Connection** to verify the Trezor connection is
working.

We will now use DMT to enter some basic information about the masternode
and extract the transaction ID. Carry out the following sequence of
steps as shown in this screenshot:

   Genix Masternode Tool configuration steps

#. Click the **New** button.
#. Enter a name for your masternode. The host name you specified 
   for your VPS above is a good choice.
#. Enter the IP address of your masternode. This was given to you
   by the VPS provider when you set up the server. Then enter the TCP 
   port number. This should be 9999.
#. Click **Locate collateral** to view unused collateral funding 
   transactions available on the connected hardware wallet. Select the 
   address to which you sent 1000 Genix and click **Apply**. The 
   **Collateral address**, **path**, **Collateral TX hash** and
   **index** fields should be filled automatically.
