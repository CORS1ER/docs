#~ "Dash Core Wallet on Linux, macOS "
#~ "and Windows systems. While they are "
#~ "somewhat out of date, the procedure "

#~ "rather than https://www.dashpay.io/ as stated"
#~ " in the videos, although the old "
#~ "site will redirect you to the new"

#~ "Dash Core, application data such as "
#~ "the blockchain is now stored in "
#~ "the \"DashCore\" rather than \"Dash\" "
#~ "folder."
