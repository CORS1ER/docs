"PrivateSend, released as DarkSend in 0.9-RC4 of the DarkCoin client and "
"rebranded to PrivateSend in May 2016, is a trustless method of running a "
"sequence of transactions (known as \"mixing\") such that an external "
"observer is unable to determine the source of funding when a PrivateSend "
"transaction is created. This gives your Dash the same privacy properties "
"as cash withdrawn from an ATM, for example. The mixing and denomination "
"process is seamless, automatic, and requires no intervention on the part "
"of the user. The current implementation of PrivateSend in the Dash Core "
"wallet allows any amount of Dash to be mixed for later use in PrivateSend"
