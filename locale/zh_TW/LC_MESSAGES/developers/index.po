"A multi-phased fork, colloquially known as a \"spork\", is a mechanism "

"network-level variables to avoid the risk of unintended network forking "
"during upgrades. It can also be used to disable certain features if a "
"security vulnerability is discovered - see :ref:`here <sporks>` for a brief "
"introduction to sporks. This documentation describes the meaning of each "
"spork currently existing on the network, and how to check their respective "
