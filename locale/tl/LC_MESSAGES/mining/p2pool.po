"This guide describes how to set up a Dash P2Pool node to manage a pool of "
"miners. Unlike centralized mining pools, P2Pool is based on the same "
"peer-2-peer (P2P) model as Dash, making the pool as a whole highly resistant"
" to malicious attacks, and preserving and protecting the decentralized "
"nature of Dash. When you launch a P2Pool node, it seeks out, connects with, "
"and shares data with a decentralized network of other P2Pool nodes (also "
"known as peers). P2Pool nodes share a cryptographic chain of data "
"representing value, similar to Dash's blockchain. The P2Pool version is "
"called the sharechain. The decentralized and fair nature of this mining "
"model means mining with P2Pool is strongly encouraged. P2Pool for Dash uses "
"the `p2pool-dash <https://github.com/dashpay/p2pool-dash>`_ software on "
"GitHub, which is a fork of p2pool for Bitcoin. For more information, see "
"`here <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/P2Pool>`__."

"Because of the way P2Pool manages difficulty adjustments on the sharechain, "
"it is important to maintain low latency between the miners and the P2Pool "
"node to avoid miners submitting shares too late to enter the sharechain. "
"When setting up your node, you need to consider its physical and network "
"location relative to the miners you intend to connect to the node. If you "
"operate a mining farm, your P2Pool node should probably be a physical "
"machine on the same local network as your miners. If you plan to operate a "
"public node, it may be best to set up your P2Pool node as a virtual machine "
"in a data center with a high speed connection so geographically close miners"
" can mine to your pool with relatively low latency."

"accessible to the public. How this is done depends on your particular "
"network router and is therefore beyond the scope of this documentation. An "
"example from the popular DD-WRT open source router distribution is shown "
"below. Guides to setting up port forwarding can be found `here "
